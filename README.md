# About

This project provides a clear and practical example of how to build, package, and deploy an AWS Lambda function using Docker and Amazon ECR, all managed with Terraform. It serves as a simple starting point for container-based Lambdas, infrastructure-as-code workflows, and automated cloud setups.
